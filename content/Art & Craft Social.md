**Art & Craft Social** is a free community event bringing together a diverse group of artists, makers, designers, and craftspeople of all levels of experience to share and create in a social setting.

All are welcome. This is an inclusive space for women, women identifying, and LGBTQ2+ people to feel safe and welcome.

**How it works**: Bring a small creative project with you to work on at Art & Craft Social. It can be anything from drawing, painting, stitching, crocheting, collage, etc. The Social provides an opportunity to meet new people, get inspired, and learn something new through exposure to the creative work of each person’s project
