A community space that is also the home of Mark & Yoo-Mi in East Vancouver.

> This is where we live.
>
>It is also the home of great community events: musical, literary, theatrical, activist, and whatever else can be dreamed-up by the creative people who are bringing depth and vibrancy to Vancouver. These events are run exclusively on [gift economy](https://notional.space/about-notional-space/a-gift-economy-project/) principles.

> We'd love to see you at each and every event we host -- not only to support those who bring light and heat, pop and fizz to our world, but because you deserve evenings this good.
