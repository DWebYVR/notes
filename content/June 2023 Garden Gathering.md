​The DWebYVR [[Conveners]] are meeting in the garden. Get a mini tour of the garden, and talk about what our next plans are on what to work on.

​Please add to the agenda on Github [https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/discussions/34](https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/discussions/34)

## Notes

Original Agenda

- [[Hackathon July 2023]] - Timing isn’t going to work; let’s do a hack day in September when weather is less nice out. See if [[Wesley Finck]] wants to run with this
- [[Stolon Mesh]] - let’s get the garden as part of the mesh? Currently has [[Living Systems Network]] Wi-Fi name; get details from [[Emily McGill]] on the system
- [[CoSocial]] - [[Boris Mann]] wants to do some Fediverse presentations eventually 
- [[DWebYVR Lemmy Community]] - didn’t talk about this at all! We don’t have a very social media forward set of folks yet

Let’s combine co-op/collective/co-housing and generally good energy people together. 

Cadence of drop in. [[CoFoodVancouver]] garden dinners and [[The Permanent]] code / tech / etc drop in. Plan out some times. 

Have some hosts for both spaces. Get hosts that aren’t [[Emily McGill]] or [[Boris Mann]] 

Maybe some at The Permanent could be during the day? Like the [Cowork & Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/events/fkjfnrybcfbgb/) that used to happen

> We are starting a lightweight meetup series for people to get together and cowork and have our morning coffees.
> 
> Is there a language or technology you always wanted to explore? Only have an hour before you have to run for your morning standup? Just need to get some work done? No matter the language, level or how much time you have to spare - show up!

Maybe David L would be interested. 

Rithika
- needs to make a people page ;)
- look at the site here, think about describing shared goals? EG [[DWeb Principles]] — what else for Vancouver specific stuff? 

Boris connect Rithika to NYC Rust people - b5, Claudia
