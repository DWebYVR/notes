Planning thread https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/discussions/35

**What:** A one day weekend hackathon to bring together people working on a variety of DWeb protocols. Code together, learn together in a shared space, and learn about each others projects and progress.

Planning for max 50 attendees. People can do small group teaching and workshopping on projects / code together.

Lunch? Lots of places nearby to go to, encourage people to go out together in groups.

Social at end of day, with lightning talk / demos of progress?
