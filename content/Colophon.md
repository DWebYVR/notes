This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered website, built using the [[Quartz]]. From the features of that template, [[wikilinks]] -- double square brackets around words -- can be used to easily link between notes, and show which notes link to each other in the sidebar.


This site is built and hosted using [[Github]]. For every commit, a Github Action runs and builds a Jekyll site, and then publishes to Github Pages. The `dwebyvr.org` domain is hosted on [[Google Domains]].

Issues related to the website can be [submitted on GitHub](https://github.com/DWebYVR/notes/issues).
