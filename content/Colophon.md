## Current Site

Implemented by [[Jacky Zhao]] on Feb 11th, 2023.

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered website, built using [[Quartz]].

From the features of that template, [[wikilinks]] -- double square brackets around words -- can be used to easily link between notes, and show [[backlnks]] -- which notes link to each other -- in the sidebar. 

This site is built and hosted using [[Github]]. For every commit, a Github Action runs and builds the HTML version of the site, and then publishes to Github Pages. 

The `dwebyvr.org` domain is hosted on [[Google Domains]].

Issues related to the website can be [submitted on GitHub](https://github.com/DWebYVR/notes/issues).

## Early Feb 2023

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) powered website, built using the [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]]. From the features of that template, [[wikilinks]] -- double square brackets around words -- can be used to easily link between notes, and show which notes link to each other in the sidebar.

The [Littlefoot JS library](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot) powers inline footnotes.
