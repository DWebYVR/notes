A [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/) that ran Cowork & Coffee for several years:

> Cowork & Coffee is a lightweight meetup series for people to get together and cowork and have our morning coffees.  
>
>Is there a language or technology you always wanted to explore? Only have an hour before you have to run for your morning standup? Just need to get some work done? No matter the language, level or how much time you have to spare - show up!  
>
>MUST HAVE: An upbeat positive attitude and have zero tolerance for stereotypes.
