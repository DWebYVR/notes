[[Boris Mann]] kicked off a DWeb Toronto event on [Feb 16th, 2023, at Halo Brewery](https://lu.ma/qpfnxd78).

Hopefully the Toronto community will get fully kicked off with a web presence, in the mean time here is the [Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIEQZGQ8a3ELq9RGh4uQtAeiOGuhYS7fBPlAGuLSyUTWjEhDzCaJw0KfGDCS4xvsihOzy) if you are interested in helping to convening more DWeb activity in Toronto. 

[[James Walker]] and [[Benedict Lau]] are Signal group admins.
