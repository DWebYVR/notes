​Come catalyze the Vancouver DWeb node!

Join us for an evening of socializing and networking with other digital creators and technologists in Vancouver. This is a budding network event series coalescing around the decentralized web. You'll want to come to meet others with similar interests, discuss projects, and spark collaboration. Whether you're new to the scene or a veteran, all are welcome.

​The night is hosted at [[The Permanent]], a new co-working and event space in Gastown with a penchant for all things decentralized web, and home to the [[Internet Archive Canada]] which sponsors the space for our events.

Enjoy some snacks, hot tea and a cash bar.

​The night is unconference-style, featuring short talks by YOU! When you register, indicate whether you'd like to take 5-10 minutes to share an initiative, invite collaboration, or put out a call to action for the dweb community. There are 5 speaking slots, so get your name in quick!

​Doors at 6:30, talks roughly 6:45-7:45, social time to 8:30.

## Talks

1) The evening will kick off with host [[Emily McGill]] of Living Systems Network talking about the launch, trajectory and potential of the DWeb Vancouver node, and how to get involved.

2) [[Ryan Betts]] from [[Fission]] presenting the [Webnative SDK](https://webnative.dev): passwordless logins with DIDs, secure encrypted data on top of [[IPFS]] for front end devs to build apps with user owned data.
