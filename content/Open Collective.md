[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) is:

> a legal and financial toolbox for grassroots groups. Itâ€™s a fundraising + legal status + money management platform for your community.

DWebYVR uses it as a transparent budgeting and expense management platform. Basic expenses include domain name registration. We can help facilitate sponsorships to help pay for event supplies -- power bars and extension cables for hackathons, drinks & snacks for events, etc.

We may host certain community sub-projects in the future, fundraising for code, education, and other projects.
