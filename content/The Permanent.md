The physical headquarters of [[Internet Archive Canada]]. 330 West Pender Street in Downtown Vancouver, just a block from the DCTRL hackerspace.

> Erected a century ago, the venue is named after the BC Permanent & Loan Company, which first opened itsâ€™ doors in 1907. In 1935, the Bank of Canada called this place home, leaving it's mark for decades to come. Recently, The Permanent was completely restored, bringing a landmark, heritage space back to the community. 
>
> The original Bank of Canada vault door still stands tall at the head of our main hall, with the jaw-droppingly beautiful stained glass atrium over head. Other neo-classical elements are adorned through out - in the crown mouldings, the bronze chandeliers, and the many tile mosaics. State of the art equipment has been installed through out as well as a custom 16 foot heritage bar.
