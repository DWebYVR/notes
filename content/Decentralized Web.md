> DWeb connects the people, projects and protocols essential to building a decentralized web. A web that is more private, reliable, secure and open. A web with many winners—returning to the original vision of the World Wide Web and internet.

From the origin story:

> In 2019, the Decentralized Web became known as the “DWeb,” and organizers decided to create an altogether new experience, [DWeb Camp](https://dwebcamp.org/). Set on a remote farm off the coast of California, the camp drew 450 builders and dreamers reimagining our relationship to technology and the planet. A co-created event, DWeb Camp inspired organizers from Berlin to Shanghai, Austin to Prague to step forward and  form local “nodes” of those curious about decentralized tech. These groups around the globe continue to meet, write and share knowledge.
