Evening gatherings in the garden, approximately monthly. We're just getting started so the later months are likely to shift.

Join us in the [[coFood Collaborative Garden]] between 5pm - 8pm. Bring food to enjoy on your own or bring some to share. Open introductions and sharing of community projects.
