We see the DWeb YVR community as a platform to connect with others who share interest in [[DWeb Principles]].

## Example Contributions

Some examples of ways to take action:

### Share and contribute DWeb content on social.

See our [[Contact]] page for all our social channels. Help spread posts tagged with #DWebYVR, and tag your own content.

### Start a Discussion

Have an idea you'd like feedback on, looking for collaborators, or want to promote? Kick off a [discussion on Github](https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/discussions).

### Add content to the website

DWeb resources, information about [[Protocols]], curating [[Organizations]], improving documentation, or similar content is all welcome. You can [[explore|explore the graph of notes »]]

Add a [person page](/tags/Person) for yourself with links to your profiles and projects. Follow the steps below to do so via Github, directly from your browser:

1. Navigate to the [website's github repo](https://github.dev/DWebYVR/notes) (URL is the same but switch out github.**com** with github.**dev**)
2. Click on the branch icon on the bottom a select *Create New Branch*. You'll be prompted to create a fork, do so and continue to naming your new branch.
3. Now within the *Content* folder navigate to the folder called *Templates*. Copy the *Person-Organization-Project Template.md* file and paste it back into the main *Content* folder. Rename the file and edit the contents as you see fit!
4. Once you’re done adding your info, click on the source control icon on the left sidebar. 
5. Here you’ll see all the changes you’ve made. Write a commit message at the top with a brief description of what you’re doing (e.g. “adding organization” or "editing bio"), and then press the *commit and push* button/icon once you're done.
6. In this same tab, click the *create pull request* icon on the topbar. Make sure the branch under “INTO” is set to **hugo** and scroll down to add a description (optional), as well as submit your pull request. 
7. Someone from the DWeb YVR team will review your changes and they’ll be live on the website soon.
