Inspired by the [[Code & Coffee]], we're planning on  weekly/every other week /monthly drop in at [[The Permanent]]. 

Hosts
* [[Ryan Betts]]
* [[Boris Mann]]
* (get in touch / add your name)

## Venue

The Internet Archive is our venue sponsor, with their downtown Vancouver space [[The Permanent]]. We'll have some chairs and tables and wifi available.

The space is quite large, so you can find a corner for a small meeting or group activity. We set up the bank vault if you need to have a more private meeting (it even has wifi!). Let us know when you're registering if there's anything special you're interested in.

## Register for Drop-In

While it is OK to drop-in, we'd like to know who's coming so we can prepare the space. Please [register](https://lu.ma/dwebyvr-dropin) to let us know you're coming.

You can RSVP for all of the drop-ins, or pick and choose sessions. Small meetings and other group activities are totally fine -- just let us know!

​Thanks again to [[Internet Archive Canada]] for hosting the space & happy hour.

We're going to be working on a regular fall schedule 
* Looking for hosts. David said he could activate [[Code & Coffee]] that he used to host.
* Maybe Wednesdays, alternating mornings and afternoons?
* We might make happy hour a regular thing as well, maybe "last Wednesday of the month" or something like that
