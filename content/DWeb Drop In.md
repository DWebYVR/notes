Inspired by the Cowork & Coffee, we're planning on  weekly/every other week /monthly drop in at [[The Permanent]].

Hosts
* [[Ryan Betts]]
* [[Boris Mann]]
* (get in touch / add your name)

## Venue

[[The Permanent]] is our venue sponsor. We'll have some chairs and tables and wifi available.

The space is quite large, so you can find a corner for a small meeting or group activity. Let us know when you're registering.

## Register for Drop-In

While it is OK to drop-in last minute, we'd like to know who's coming so we can prepare the space. Please [register](https://lu.ma/dwebyvr-dropin) to let us know you're coming.

You can RSVP for all of the drop-ins, or pick and choose sessions. Small meetings and other group activities are totally fine -- just let us know!
