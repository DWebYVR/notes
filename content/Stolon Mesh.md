The [Stolon Mesh](https://www.stolonmesh.ca) is a project being run by [[221A]] to bring a wireless [[Mesh Network]] to Chinatown and the DTES.

> _this mesh begins as a stolon (a community mesh network)_ will see the design, development, and building of a mesh network within Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. Inspired by 221A’s [x̱aw̓s shew̓áy̓ New Growth《新生林》garden](https://semi-public.com/), this project will take the time to consider strategies for expanding and developing this necessary infrastructure in ways that are both responsive and responsible to the surrounding community. Pulling from strategies found within plant systems and networks, the project aims to take advantage of the foresight offered by having both the time and space to consider the ways in which a MESH might be introduced, constructed, and utilized by the community.
