[Tomo Spaces](https://tomospaces.com/) is a real estate company building at the intersection of “hardwhere” and “softwhere,” where physical space and intangible activities meet. As developers, operators, and researchers, we believe in the power of place to enable people to do amazing things. Our research-driven approach challenges us to engage with complex urban issues. Since 2005, we’ve cultivated award-winning places like Schoolhouse in Vancouver and River Market in New Westminster.
