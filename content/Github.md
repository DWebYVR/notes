We have a Github organization at <https://github.com/DWebYVR>

The [notes repo](https://github.com/DWebYVR/notes) is where the source code for this website is available. The [[Colophon]] details how the website is built.

[Discussion forums are enabled](https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/discussions) for long form discussions and coordination of the group.

The [issues list](https://github.com/DWebYVR/notes/issues) can be used for everything from basic task tracking to website content and design. There is a [project board interface](https://github.com/orgs/DWebYVR/projects/1).
