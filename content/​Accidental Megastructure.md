> In _[The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty](https://thestack.org/)_, Benjamin H. Bratton proposes that these different genres of computation—smart grids, cloud plaforms, mobile apps, smart cities, the Internet of Things, automation— can be seen not as so many species evolving on their own, but as forming a coherent whole: an ==accidental megastructure called The Stack that is both a computational apparatus and a new governing architecture==. We are inside The Stack and it is inside of us.
