Paul d'Aoust writes, draws pictures, and talks to people about [[Holochain]] (and sometimes takes photos and has even been known to cook chicken soup in his course of duty). He lives on a homestead in rural Okanagan (unceded Syilx territory) and only works at his day job part-time. He once launched a community garden in his hometown, and is very happy to see it thriving without his help. Paul is interested in community building, digital tools for conviviality, and fermentation.
