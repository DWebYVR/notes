## Connecting people, projects and protocols to build a decentralized web

The DWeb Community <https://getdweb.net/> is an initiative guided by the [[Internet Archive]]. This is the Vancouver region DWeb Node. You can browse the other [regional nodes](https://getdweb.net/#nodes) on the DWeb site.

We believe in the [[DWeb Principles]].

## What is a DWeb Node?

We are the Vancouver regional DWeb Node. Anyone can [apply to run a node](https://getdweb.net/start-a-dweb-node/):

> Nodes are for establishing a local hub for conversations and networking around DWeb projects. They serve to educate, share knowledge, and connect people of diverse backgrounds interested in building a better web. They are not for companies to promote their products. Please consider who else in your area would be involved in this node.

## Conveners

You can see the current [Conveners](/tags/Convener) who choose to be publicly listed. This is a volunteer organization which collaborates on a variety of projects.

Our current focus is on booting up DWeb activities in Vancouver. We do this by managing a communiy [[Calendar]] and taking turns in organizing monthly meetings at [[The Permanent]].

We welcome additional people, protocols, and projects to get involved and organize more events and activities, as we build shared platforms.

[[contact|Get in touch]] to participate, all are welcome.
