Did you know that the Internet Archive now has a Canadian edition? And that they have an amazing space in downtown Vancouver that supports everything from servers to socials?

​Join the Fission team & Internet Archive Canada at The Permanent for an evening of presentations, lightning talks, and the first of hopefully many sociotechnical conversations connecting the Decentralized Web in Vancouver and beyond.

​If you’re interested in tech, open source, decentralization, policy, or any similar sociotechnical topics, come join us!

## ​Agenda

### ​6pm
​
Doors open. Presentations will start promptly, followed by Q&A.

### ​6:30pm - An overview of Check My Ads, Claire Atkin

​Claire is the cofounder of Check My Ads, the adtech watchdog. Check My Ads is dismantling the disinformation economy via the 400 billion dollar digital advertising industry. They have taken millions of advertising dollars from Steve Bannon, Dan Bongino, Charlie Kirk, and other insurrectionists. This summer they launched a campaign to defund Fox News’s website for brand safety violations regarding election disinformation.

### ​6:45pm - The Big World of the Fediverse, Blaine Cook
​
Blaine was a founding engineer at Twitter, and at one time had code running that made it interoperable with other networks. Fast forward 15 years, and we’re witnessing an explosion of of interoperable, standards based social networks and messaging platforms. Blaine Cook will give a tour of the wide world of the Fediverse as it is now, as well as some of the work he’s doing at Fission.

### ​7:30pm Social
