[Holochain](https://holochain.org) is a general toolkit for building peer-to-peer applications in which peers store and validate each other's data. In spite of the name, it's got nothing to do with blockchain; it just happens to use Merkle chains as a data structure.

People in Vancouver and surrounds associated with the protocol:

* [[Emily McGill]]
* [[Paul d'Aoust]]
* [[Wesley Finck]]
