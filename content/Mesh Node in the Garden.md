The [[Stolon Mesh]] has an initial node in Chinatown in the garden on Union Street off Gore.

We're looking at setting up a community node in the [[coFood Collaborative Garden]].

## Notes

* We have a small budget from the [[221A]] / [[Stolon Mesh]] project to get the necessary hardware.
* Need to schedule time for [[Emily McGill]] to give us a tour and [[Jacob Sayles]] to review what is there.
* Order hardware
* Book an install party time
* Look at ongoing uplink costs
* Are there people in the neighbourhood that might want to mesh? Boris knows a few people in the area, as does Emily.
## People & Orgs

* [[Emily McGill]] and [[Living Systems Network]] host the garden and can give access to the container and some power
