title: Using Luma to Run Events
---

[Luma](https://lu.ma) is a simple event organizing and registration tool. We use it for events, as well as to manage the collaborative [DWeb YVR Calendar](../calendar/).

## Custom Questions

We can add custom questions to a Luma event that people will see and can fill out as part of registration. Below are some standard and example questions.

### Community Announcements

We ask people ahead of time if they have any community announcements to share. We can then include them as part of slides, and easily send relevant links to attendees after the event.

Example question text:

> Do you have a community announcement to make? Good examples would be an upcoming event, an open source project, or other DWeb related info. We'll ask you to give a brief 30 second pitch after the talks.

Make the question a "Long Text", and don't make it Required.

### Recruiting Speakers

For [[Lightning Talks]], we can also use registration to recruit speakers.

> Do you want to give a lightning talk? We're looking for 5-10 minute presentations. This could be a technical demo, education about dweb, an overview of a project you're working on, or similar. Let us know what you want to talk about, any links to more info, and anything else you want to share.

Also set the question to "Long Text", and also don't make it required.
