This site is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site, built using the [[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]]. From the features of that template, [[wikilinks]] -- double square brackets around words -- can be used to easily link between notes, and show which notes link to each other in the sidebar.

The [Littlefoot JS library](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot) powers inline footnotes.

This site is built and hosted using [[Github]].
