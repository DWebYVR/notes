Aliases can be created using Google Domains.

`collaborate@dwebyvr.org` is a public forwarding address pointing at `dwebyvr@googlegroups.com` to power a shared inbox for [[Conveners]].

## Signal

Other than the public [[Contact]] group, there is also a moderated [Conveners Signal Group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIGgqR2GDtrkudmah4a19GzSxVCWPLKf5BBKHOd79aleFEhCNd9ByyeFfTuQv8yjFG_Xq). We strive to discuss most topics transparently and openly, so the public group is used for most things.

There is an [[Open Collective]] with [[emcgill]] & [[bmann]] as admins.
