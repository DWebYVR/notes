A Digital Garden or Second Brain is an interconnected set of notes that show how information and concepts are connected to each other.

The [[Explore Notes]] page shows both recently updated notes, as well as a visual graph explorer of how all the notes connect to each other.

There are an emerging class of apps and tools, such as [[Obsidian]], [[LogSeq]], [[Massive Wiki]], that make it easy for people to keep notes in this way, that grow interconnected over time.

The square brackets you see are [[wikilinks]], and is how notes are easily linked using just their name, without having to look up an HTML link or file path. If you see that a wikilink doesn't actually link to a page (and you'll see a "?" cursor when you hover over it), it means that that page doesn't exist. It's waiting for someone to come along and create it.

Yes, it's kind of unusual to use this kind of technique for a community website. We think it's a good fit for [[DWeb Principles]] -- that we're collectively gathering and sharing information.
