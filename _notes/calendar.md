We use [[Luma]] to manage a shared collaborative calendar for DWeb events in Vancouver. The direct link to the calendar is <https://lu.ma/dwebyvr>, and we've also embedded it below.

You can subscribe by email to get updates of new events.

## Adding Events to the Calendar

While [[Luma]] is used to manage the calendar, the events can be run using any system[^eventsites]. You will need to at least sign up for a basic, free Luma account in order to submit an event.

Or, tell us about your event by [[contact|getting in touch]].

[^eventsites]: Feel free to use your own Eventbrite, Meetup.com, or any other event system. Weâ€™ll just include a link to your registration page.
