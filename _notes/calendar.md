We use [[Luma]] to manage a shared collaborative calendar for DWeb events in Vancouver. The direct link to the calendar is <https://lu.ma/dwebyvr>, and we've also embedded it below:

<iframe
  src="https://lu.ma/dwebyvr"
  width="95%"
  height="800"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen=""
  aria-hidden="false"
  tabindex="0"
></iframe>

## Adding Events to the Calendar

While Luma is used to manage the calendar, the events can be run using any system. You will need to at least sign up for a basic, free Luma account in order to submit an event.

Or, tell us about your event by [[contact|getting in touch]].
