We've included it directly below, with clarifications and specific info for the Vancouver node.\n\n## Overview​\n\nThe Decentralized Web network hosts events that bring together a community of professionals from around the world. It is a space inclusive of persons of all backgrounds, orientations and identities. Dialogue, mutual respect and sharing are at the foundation of the Decentralized Web community and we expect all participants to follow these values. These guidelines help us establish collective trust and engage in productive deliberation.\n\nYour safety and comfort are our priority. If you have questions or concerns at any point before, during or after the conference, contact one of the [[Conveners]].\n\nThese guidelines apply to all spaces, real and virtual, during all DWeb events, as well as during set-up and tear down.\n\nFor DWeb YVR, this includes the channels listed on the [[Contact]] page.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n### 01. Respect\n\nAll participants and event staff should strive to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion.\n\nRespect the privacy–both physical and digital–of others.\n\nIf you want to take a picture, make sure you have consent from the participants. Wearing a yellow lanyard signifies people who have asked not to be photographed.\nFollow the Chatham House Rule when mentioned:\n“When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”\n\n### 02. Collaboration\n\nBe open to new ideas and learning from others–we are stronger when we share.\n\nIn moments of strong disagreement, we ask participants to “agree to disagree,” stay focused on the goals of the session or discussion, and move on to address shared needs and shared opportunities.\n\nWe encourage all present to make it a point where possible to talk to strangers and those you know less well, as they are hopefully friends you have not yet met.\n\n### 03. Inclusion\n\nWhen in doubt, mingle! We all have different perspectives that can help each other in worthwhile and unexpected ways.\n\nIn this spirit, avoid jargon, acronyms and complicated phrasing whenever possible.\n\nEveryone at Decentralized Web events should feel included and it is to everyone’s advantage to be mindful and productively engaged with people from a variety of cultural contexts, communities and regions.\n\nFollow the “Rule of 1” and the “Rule of n”: When you speak, make 1 point and then let others speak, and when in a group of “n” people, speak “1/nth” of the time.\n\n### 04. Communication\n\nWhen listening to input and comments of others, start by assuming the most benign interpretation and the best intention of the speaker. If a comment is phased in a way that might be misinterpreted, ask for clarification of the statement or intent. If the comment is discomforting (or hostile), please reach out to an event organizer.\n\nWhether in panels or in informal conversation, be mindful not to interrupt others. Listen actively and others will return in kind.\n\nAvoid grandstanding whenever possible and allow others to participate. The more concise and relatable your point is, the greater impact it will have on other participants.\n\n## Unacceptable Behavior\n\nWe will not tolerate predatory behavior or disregard for other persons, either personally or professionally, from or towards anyone—be it speakers, staff or participants.\n\nWe will not tolerate harassment in any form.\n\nIf you are being harassed, you notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organizer or use prudence and attempt to mitigate the action yourself. Do not resort to physical contact except in self defense.\n\nThose who violate our code of conduct may be warned, sanctioned, or expelled at the discretion of the organizers with no refund.\n\n## Raising Issues at a DWeb Vancouver Event\n\nIf you believe you‘re experiencing practices at the DWeb event that do not meet our Code of Conduct guidelines, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact one of the [[Conveners]]. You may also contact the \u003ca href=\"mailto:ethics@archive.org\"\u003eDWeb Code of Conduct Team\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nThe DWeb Vancouver conveners reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T22:44:12.38298214Z","tags":null},"/Colophon":{"title":"Colophon","content":"\n## Current Site\n\nImplemented by [[Jacky Zhao]] on Feb 11th, 2023.\n\nThis is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered website, built using [[Quartz]] and designed to be managed with [[Obsidian]].\n\nFrom the features of that template, [[wikilinks]] -- double square brackets around words -- can be used to easily link between notes, and show [[backlnks]] -- which notes link to each other -- in the sidebar. \n\nThis site is built and hosted using [[Github]].

Technology for Human Agency\n1. We stand for technology that enables the primacy of people as beneficiaries of the technology, by upholding their security, privacy and self-determination.\n1. We urge coexistence and interoperability, and discourage walled gardens.\n1. We value open source code as a fundamental building block of an open and inclusive Web.\n1. We aim for peer-to-peer relationships, rather than hierarchical control and power imbalance.\n1. Our technologies must minimize surveillance and manipulation of people’s behavior, and optimize for social benefits and empower individuals to determine how and why their data is used.\n1. We believe that multiple technical means will be more effective than a single technical solution to achieve ethical and people-centric outcomes.\n\n## 02. Distributed Benefits\n1. We believe that decentralized technologies will be most beneficial to society when the rewards and recognition of their success, monetary or otherwise, are distributed among those who contributed to that success.\n1. If that is infeasible, proportionate benefit should flow to the community at large.\n1. High concentration of organizational control is antithetical to the decentralized web.\n\n## 03. Mutual Respect\n1. We support and encourage clear codes of conduct to ensure respectful behavior and accountability.\n1. We expect participants to remain mindful of, and take responsibility for, their speech and behavior, by acting out of respect for others and respecting physical and emotional boundaries.\n1. We stand for open and transparent organizational practices, motivations, and governance, in a manner that actively pursues equity, mutual trust, and respect.\n\n## 04. Humanity\n1. The objective of building a decentralized web is to protect human rights and empower people, especially those who experience systemic inequity and prejudice.\n1. We stand for people having agency over their own data and relationships, rights to free expression, privacy, and knowledge, as these are essential to human empowerment and dignity.\n1. We condemn the use of distributed tools for activities antithetical to human rights, such as human trafficking; sexual, mental, or physical abuse; and arms trading.\n1. We encourage building with harm-reduction in mind, and support the adoption of mechanisms that mitigate the potential for abuse, and consideration of those ‘not at the table’ — not connected, not users, and the disadvantaged.\n1. We encourage the development of tools and applications in many languages and forms, with a high degree of accessibility.\n\n## 05. Ecological Awareness\n1. We believe projects should aim to minimize ecological harm and avoid technologies that worsen environmental health.\n1. We value systems that work towards reducing energy consumption and device resource requirements, while increasing device lifespan by allowing repair, recycling, and recovery.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T22:44:12.38298214Z","tags":null},"/Dark-Matter-Labs":{"title":"Dark Matter Labs","content":"\n[Dark Matter Labs](https://darkmatterlabs.org/) works with partners, clients, and collaborators across the world, researching and developing new institutional support frameworks for collaborative system change.

Set on a remote farm off the coast of California, the camp drew 450 builders and dreamers reimagining our relationship to technology and the planet. A co-created event, DWeb Camp inspired organizers from Berlin to Shanghai, Austin to Prague to step forward and  form local “nodes” of those curious about decentralized tech.
